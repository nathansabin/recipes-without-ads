# Recipe Without Ads
  
  ## Description

This application solved a real-world issue of mine: recipe websites are not designed for mobile and are full of clutter and ads. I attempted to find the cook time for airfrying chicken breast, but it took me 5 minutes to get through the site. So my webapp has a react front end with tailwind for style and Redux advanced state management and a springboot backend that works with webscraping. Deployment handled with AWS elastic beanstalk and S3 bucket.
